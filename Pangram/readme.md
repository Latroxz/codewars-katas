## Pangram Detection

A **pangram** is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once.

### Example

For instance:

- The sentence `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` is a pangram because it uses the letters `A-Z` at least
  once (case is irrelevant).

### Problem Statement

Given a string, determine whether or not it is a pangram.

### Output

- Return `True` if the string is a pangram.
- Return `False` if it is not.

### Notes

- **Ignore numbers** and **punctuation** in the evaluation.
- Casing is irrelevant when determining if all letters of the alphabet are present.
