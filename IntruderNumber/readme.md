# Find the "Different Element" in the Array

Given an array (with a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers, the array is entirely comprised of **either odd integers or even integers**, except for a single integer `N`. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this **"different element"** `N`.

## Examples:

```plaintext
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] --> 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --> 160 (the only even number)

[6, 8, 10, 3, 12, 14, 16] --> 3 (the only odd number)

[1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11] --> 2 (the only even number)
